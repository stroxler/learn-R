# Grab-bag for work as I learn / relearn R

I did a lot of R in grad school, but (a) my R is very rusty, and (b) after
working more in python and Java with professional software engineers, my
standards for 'knowing' a language have grown to include standard packaging /
documentation / testing.

This repository is to help me as I work through various books, courses,
and tutorial, seeking to
  - Refresh my statistical computing skills, which are out-of-practice
  - Re-learn R basics
  - Learn proper R software engineering
  - Learn to integrate C and C++ with R
