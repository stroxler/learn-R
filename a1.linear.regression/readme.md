# Demonstration R package based on solving the linear regression problem.

The one-time code used to fetch resources and create the package, which
does not belong as part of the package per se but I just want to keep as
documentation, lives in `inst/scripts`

The location `inst/extdata`, where I keep my data, is a standard location
for non-binary data (the location `data` is used for Rdata files, which is
the preferred way to store data - I use .txt files in this case as a demo,
but for later assignments I'll use a script to convert the raw data into
.Rdata files).
