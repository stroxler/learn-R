# Repository following along with Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning Course

This repository has two main purposes, for my personal development
  1. Get back into shape with R by going through some Machine Learning basics
  2. Practice using good development practices in R: packages for code, and
     vignettes for reports.
